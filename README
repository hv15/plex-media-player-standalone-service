The PMP standalone service is based upon the [Kodi Standalone service](https://github.com/graysky2/kodi-standalone-service)
by graysky <graysky AT archlinux DOT us>, many thanks to graysky. Additionally, I'd like to thank the maintainers of
the [Plex Media Player AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plex-media-player/) package for their work.
